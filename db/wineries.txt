The primary gods were Boreas (North), Eurus (East), Notus (South) and Zephyrus (West). Numerous minor deities represented everything from Southeast to North-North West.<p>\r\nThousands of years later, we, as grape growers in Colorado's Grand Valley, pay homage to these very winds, whether they come from the west baked by the desert and sand or from the east flowing atop the Colorado River through Debeque Canyon, which provide our hot days and cool nights both of which provide better ripening and a more complex wine.<p>\r\nThe Anemoi are still very much alive and play a key role in the creation of our wines. Like the personalities of the winds, each wine possesses distinctive characteristics produced by the winds and ever-changing weather. Each Anemoi wine is named for the god that best represents its individuality and reflects its growing season. It was the cool summer of 2009 that led to the creation of our first wine, Boreas, and the genesis of Anemoi Wines.<p>\r\nThe product of estate-grown fruit, the fructifying winds and a modern spin on traditional winemaking, Anemoi is the next generation of Colorado wine.","The Anemoi were the mythological Greek gods of wind who were each named for the cardinal direction from which their winds came.<p>The product of estate-grown fruit, the fructifying winds, and a modern spin on traditional winemaking, Anemoi is the next generation of Colorado wine.","2 miles east of Palisade on north side of river.

One of the largest contiguous pieces of agricultural property in Mesa County, our property encompasses 50 acres, 35 of which are planted, in two vineyards closely separated in distance yet vastly different in the grapes produced. The benefit to having such an expansive property is that we can support our entire production, which means we never have to source grapes from anywhere else and makes us one of the few (or perhaps only) estate wineries in Colorado. The tremendous versatility in these vineyards gives Canyon Wind Cellars the ability to create wines with depth and focus while never having to leave home.","Planted in 1991, Canyon Wind Cellars is a family-owned, estate winery named for the mountain breezes and canyon winds that nurture the fruit on our high altitude vineyard.

Carlson's Gewurz has won the \"Best of the Fest\" twice at the Colorado Mountain Winefest - the only winery to win two years in a row for two different vintages of the same varietal wine.<br><br>\r\nThe vineyard, one of Colorado's oldest, dates to a first planting in an old apricot orchard in 1981 and first commercial wine in 1988. As one of Colorado's biggest fruit wine producers, the winery produces 10,000 cases a year, one third of which are fruit wines.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCarlson's wines are made entirely from high-altitude, intensely-flavored Colorado-grown fruit and winegrapes. The fruit wines are 100% fruit. You'll notice the no-so-serious labels, using local motifs such as Prairie Dogs and Mythical Dinosaurs. Try \"Tyrannosaurus Red\" made from deep, peppery and fruity Lemberger grapes. Parker Carlson calls it his best \"spaghetti wine.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nStop by the historic tasting room to see why Carlson wines are so popular.

It was founded in August, 1997 by grape grower Bennett Price and his wife, Davy, following years of designing and establishing vineyards in Colorado for other wineries and growers. The winery is a natural extension of the Price's long time involvement in the industry, and especially their interest in wine making.\r\nDeBeque Canyon Winery is named for the lengthy canyon through which the Colorado River flows from the mountains into the broad Grand Valley of western Colorado. A growing season of warm days and cool nights help create the intensity of flavors which delight residents and the many visitors who travel through this green oasis in the west.<BR>\r\n<BR>Join us for a sample of old-fashioned western hospitality and excellent wines. All DeBeque Canyon wines are 100% Colorado Grown.","Located in downtown Palisade. The winery is in one of the original Palisade buildings which was built about 1903 for sorting fruit.\r\nThe winery is well known for full-flavored, oak-aged wines, especially Bordeaux and Rhone varietals as well as premium white wines and rich blended Ports, all 100% Colorado Grown.","I-70, exit 42.

Until 2006 Grande River Vineyards was Colorado's largest grape producer.\r\nBy 2006, grape growing was firmly established in the Palisade area. Grande River Vineyards owners, Steve and Naomi Smith, decided to downsize the farming operation and sell most of the vineyards to local fruit growers and concentrate on making great wine. The Smiths kept 10 acres of their original operation with about five acres of Merlot and Petit Verdot and lease back and farm about five acres of Syrah and Viognier.\r\nToday, the winery is one of more than 100 Colorado wineries and produces 5,000 cases of wine per year.\r\n","Founder Stephen Smith and his wife Naomi operate this winery which began with grapes planted in 1987.

Barbier grew up in the Loire Valley in France, where his family had been making wine for the past 150 years. Maison la Belle Vie (French for \"House of Beautiful Life\") had its first vintage from the 4.5 acre vineyard in 2006 that included Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a Vin de Peche made from a Muscat grape aged in peach leaves and peach wood with a slight sweet finish, which is a traditional wine in the Loire Valley. Three years later the winery was open to the public and the wait was well worth it.\r\nMr. Barbier's experience and expertise in winemaking as well as an intimate knowledge of the arid high-desert region of western Colorado has helped in Barbier's transition from growing fruit in France, to Colorado. The age-old practice of \"dry-farming\" is still used today in their vineyard allowing them to achieve maximum results by adding to the complexity and flavor of the fruit.\r\nMaison la Belle Vie Winery respects their vineyard and those who supply them grapes. They strive for a minimalist approach with their wine so the content of the bottle will always reflect an unmanipulated purity for the grape to shine.\r\nIn 2011 Maison la Belle Vie added 3 Reserves, a Merlot, Syrah and a Petit Verdot all aged for 4 years and a walnut liquor that is a must have for the port lovers. ","Maison la Belle Vie (French for \"House of Beautiful Life\") is a 4.5 acre vineyard, winery and wedding venue.

Simply put, it is wine made from honey instead of grapes. Like grape wine, it can be crafted with either a dry or a sweet finish. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMedovina produces its own honey, from which it hand crafts its mead. Our beeyards are nestled in Old Town Niwot, in the shade of large cottonwoods planted nearly a century ago by early homesteaders. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn what is truly a miracle of nature, flowers use photosynthesis to transform atmospheric carbon dioxide and water to nectar, a complex blend of sucrose and trace amounts of aromatics, essential oils and other delightful compounds. The bees gather this nectar from the unique flora in the Niwot area. The bees provide vital enzymes which break down the nectar into simple sugars. Inside our beehives, and over the course of several months, the nectars transform naturally into a consistently rich, premium honey. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs summer gives way to autumn, Medovina begins harvesting the honey and crafting its mead. Our Old World process preserves the rich floral extracts present in our honey. Our meads are produced naturally, without filtering or added sulfites. Alcohol, honey and acidity are harmonized by producing our meads slowly, in small batches, and barrel aging them before bottling. Further aging occurs naturally in the bottle and full maturity can be expected in 3 to 8 years, but you do not have to wait that long to enjoy them.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMedovina honey wine is a unique culinary experience, try it on a fresh palate: take three sips, then decide.","Medovina produces honey, from which it hand crafts mead.

from Colorado grown grapes, that reflect our terroir and are both innovative and pleasing to customers. This involves making wines from both established and newly introduced grape cultivars. It also involves researching distinctive blends and styles of wines that can create new market niches for the Colorado industry.\r\n\r\nWe hope these training and research experiences will help forge highly capable and committed members of the wine industry, whether they choose to stay in Colorado or go elsewhere.
