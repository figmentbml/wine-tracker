  "The Anemoi were the mythological Greek Gods of wind, named for the cardinal direction from which their winds came. The primary gods were Boreas (North), Eurus (East), Notus (South) and Zephyrus (West). Numerous minor deities represented everything from Southeast to North-North West.  Thousands of years later, we, as grape growers in Colorado's Grand Valley, pay homage to these very winds, whether they come from the west baked by the desert and sand or from the east flowing atop the Colorado River through Debeque Canyon, which provide our hot days and cool nights both of which provide better ripening and a more complex wine.  The Anemoi are still very much alive and play a key role in the creation of our wines. Like the personalities of the winds, each wine possesses distinctive characteristics produced by the winds and ever-changing weather. Each Anemoi wine is named for the god that best represents its individuality and reflects its growing season. It was the cool summer of 2009 that led to the creation of our first wine, Boreas, and the genesis of Anemoi Wines.  The product of estate-grown fruit, the fructifying winds and a modern spin on traditional winemaking, Anemoi is the next generation of Colorado wine.",

The seasonally dry creek meanders across the Eastern Plains of Colorado and drains into the South Platte River.    Our wine is made by time tested traditions handed down for generations complemented by modern technology. That combination makes our wine as good as can be made from premium, high-altitude Colorado grapes. Hot days, cool nights combined with intense sunlight make these grapes rich in color and flavor with just the right balance of acid and tannins.    Located in eastern Colorado near the town of Fort Morgan, Bijou Creek Vineyards began its commercial wine making operations in 2006. We currently receive our grapes from vineyards in the Palisade area on the Western Slope of Colorado. That area is ideal for growing vinifera or classical wine making grapes.

Cradled between the Book Cliffs and the towering Grand Mesa and nourished by the Colorado River, Canyon Wind has the premier location in the Grand Valley AVA for growing Bordeaux grape varietals. One of the largest contiguous pieces of agricultural property in Mesa County, our property encompasses 50 acres, 35 of which are planted, in two vineyards closely separated in distance yet vastly different in the grapes produced. The benefit to having such an expansive property is that we can support our entire production, which means we never have to source grapes from anywhere else and makes us one of the few (or perhaps only) estate wineries in Colorado. The tremendous versatility in these vineyards gives Canyon Wind Cellars the ability to create wines with depth and focus while never having to leave home.",

    "While we take the art of wine making seriously, we like to have fun too. Since 1988 Carlson Vineyards, a small farm winery, has produced premium wines in the heart of Colorado wine country above the town of Palisade and the Colorado River on East Orchard Mesa. A local favorite, the Carlsons are pioneers in making wines with Colorado grown, sun-ripened fruit and winegrapes.   Carlson Vineyards is well-known for Riesling wine, surpassing more than 1500 entries from around the world to win the prestigious World Cup Riesling Award in New York, the top award for Riesling! Plus Carlson's Gewurztraminers are sought after and sell out early each year. Carlson's Gewurz has won the \"Best of the Fest\" twice at the Colorado Mountain Winefest - the only winery to win two years in a row for two different vintages of the same varietal wine.   The vineyard, one of Colorado's oldest, dates to a first planting in an old apricot orchard in 1981 and first commercial wine in 1988. As one of Colorado's biggest fruit wine producers, the winery produces 10,000 cases a year, one third of which are fruit wines.    Carlson's wines are made entirely from high-altitude, intensely-flavored Colorado-grown fruit and winegrapes. The fruit wines are 100% fruit. You'll notice the no-so-serious labels, using local motifs such as Prairie Dogs and Mythical Dinosaurs. Try \"Tyrannosaurus Red\" made from deep, peppery and fruity Lemberger grapes. Parker Carlson calls it his best \"spaghetti wine.\"    Stop by the historic tasting room to see why Carlson wines are so popular. Enjoy free samples of affordable luscious reds, un-oaked Chardonnay, the Gewurz Trio, and fruit wines that stand as a signature of western Colorado. Take in the scenic vistas of the Grand Valley. Tours of our newly solar-powered winery, tastings, and sales daily from 10-5:45 except major holidays. Located on the Fruit & Wine Byway, Palisade's classic scenic cruising and bicycling route.

The infusion of high alcohol halts the fermentation, preserving the residual sugar to add weight and balance to the wine. The port ages in American and Old French Oak barrels before it is bottled. The ports produce complex bouquets of distinct aromas which evolve as you taste it. Combine the PORT II with Blue Stilton cheese and walnuts. The LIPIZZAN PORT is an aperitif or after dinner wine working well with chocolate dipped strawberries.

      "John Barbier grew up in the Loire Valley in France, where his family had been making wine for the past 150 years. Maison la Belle Vie (French for \"House of Beautiful Life\") had its first vintage from the 4.5 acre vineyard in 2006 that included Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a Vin de Peche made from a Muscat grape aged in peach leaves and peach wood with a slight sweet finish, which is a traditional wine in the Loire Valley. Three years later the winery was open to the public and the wait was well worth it. Mr. Barbier's experience and expertise in winemaking as well as an intimate knowledge of the arid high-desert region of western Colorado has helped in Barbier's transition from growing fruit in France, to Colorado. The age-old practice of \"dry-farming\" is still used today in their vineyard allowing them to achieve maximum results by adding to the complexity and flavor of the fruit. Maison la Belle Vie Winery respects their vineyard and those who supply them grapes. They strive for a minimalist approach with their wine so the content of the bottle will always reflect an unmanipulated purity for the grape to shine. In 2011 Maison la Belle Vie added 3 Reserves, a Merlot, Syrah and a Petit Verdot all aged for 4 years and a walnut liquor that is a must have for the port lovers. ",

      "Mead, or honey wine, is perhaps the oldest of alcoholic beverages. Simply put, it is wine made from honey instead of grapes. Like grape wine, it can be crafted with either a dry or a sweet finish.     Medovina produces its own honey, from which it hand crafts its mead. Our beeyards are nestled in Old Town Niwot, in the shade of large cottonwoods planted nearly a century ago by early homesteaders.     In what is truly a miracle of nature, flowers use photosynthesis to transform atmospheric carbon dioxide and water to nectar, a complex blend of sucrose and trace amounts of aromatics, essential oils and other delightful compounds. The bees gather this nectar from the unique flora in the Niwot area. The bees provide vital enzymes which break down the nectar into simple sugars. Inside our beehives, and over the course of several months, the nectars transform naturally into a consistently rich, premium honey.     As summer gives way to autumn, Medovina begins harvesting the honey and crafting its mead. Our Old World process preserves the rich floral extracts present in our honey. Our meads are produced naturally, without filtering or added sulfites. Alcohol, honey and acidity are harmonized by producing our meads slowly, in small batches, and barrel aging them before bottling. Further aging occurs naturally in the bottle and full maturity can be expected in 3 to 8 years, but you do not have to wait that long to enjoy them.    Medovina honey wine is a unique culinary experience, try it on a fresh palate: take three sips, then decide.",

A new tasting room was completed in 2014, providing a comfortable space for sampling wines and hosting private events with views overlooking the Rocky Mountains.

      "Taking the name of the snow-fed stream tumbling along the property's edge, Terror Creek Winery, at 6,400', is home to some of the world's highest-altitude vineyards. Overlooking the North Fork Valley from picturesque Garvin Mesa, this small family-owned winery offers visitors a chance to savor Alsatian-style wines in the beautiful vista of the Rockies. At the turn of the century, a Frenchman planted the first vines at Terror Creek. Today, Swiss-trained vintner and co-owner Joan Mathewson creates wines alive with fruit flavor, and crisp acidity from grapes grown exclusively in Western Colorado, where our hot sunny days, cool nights, and low humidity create ideal conditions. Established in 1993.    Join John and Joan Mathewson for a tasting from the Terror Creek Collection, which includes a dry, smooth, supple Riesling, wonderful with lamb, poultry and fish; a spicy, full-flavored, dry Gewurztraminer; a unique Chardonnay vinted without oak to preserve the fruity flavor of Chardonnay grapes; and a rich, fruity, dry Pinot Noir to sip with savory cheeses, beef and game.
