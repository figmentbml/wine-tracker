Things I'm hoping Wine Tracker will do:
- user will input wine they have had (manually and ideally using your smart phone's item scanner)
    - in order to remember wines they liked
    - come up with general preferences
    - explore wine
- user could input cost and where they purchased it
- social aspect or at least compile multiple users data to:
    - average ratings
    - average cost
    - alert to great deal on wine if someone just put a wine in for under average price.  would alert users in the area to deal.
